# AWS Deployment — E-Migration Assist

Migration plan: Replit (current prod) → AWS (new prod), keeping Replit as the dev environment.

**Target topology after cutover:**

```
Browser → www.emigration-assist.com/assessment/*   (marketing site, Vercel project)
              │  rewrite (path-stripped)
              ▼
          <assessment>.vercel.app/*                 (this repo's Vite SPA build, unchanged)
              │  XHR / fetch with credentials
              ▼
          <eb-or-ecs-url>                            (Elastic Beanstalk or ECS Fargate, af-south-1)
              │  same VPC, private subnets
              ▼
          <rds-endpoint>.rds.amazonaws.com:5432     (RDS Postgres 16, af-south-1)
```

**Region:** `af-south-1` (Cape Town) — chosen for proximity to South African users (~30–50ms baseline). **Caveat:** AWS App Runner is not deployed in af-south-1, so the backend uses Elastic Beanstalk or ECS Fargate instead (see Phase 2 below). af-south-1 also has slightly higher per-resource pricing than eu-west-1 (~15–20% premium).

**Phases:**
1. ✅ Phase 1 — Provision RDS Postgres + push schema (this document)
2. ⬜ Phase 2 — Dockerfile + Elastic Beanstalk service (recommended) — pending Phase 1 completion
3. ⬜ Phase 3 — Cutover (Vercel `VITE_API_URL` flip, backend `WEB_ORIGIN` set)
4. ⬜ Phase 4 — Lock down RDS public access, document final state

## Phase 1 — Provision RDS Postgres

### 1.1 Sizing & version recommendation

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | PostgreSQL **16.x** (latest minor) | App uses Drizzle + pg-boss v12; both fully supported on PG 16. |
| Instance class | `db.t4g.micro` (2 vCPU, 1 GB RAM) | ~$15/mo. Sufficient for current load. Easy to scale up later — no data migration needed for instance-class change. |
| Storage | **20 GB gp3**, autoscaling enabled up to 100 GB | gp3 is cheaper and more performant than gp2. Autoscaling so you never run out unexpectedly. |
| Multi-AZ | **No** (for now) | Saves ~50% cost. App is non-critical enough that ~minutes of downtime during a rare AZ failure is acceptable. Switch to Multi-AZ later when revenue justifies it (one-click change, no migration). |
| Backups | **7-day** automated, default backup window | Default. Free up to DB size. |
| Deletion protection | **Enabled** | Prevents accidental `terraform destroy` style mistakes in the AWS console. |
| Public accessibility | **Yes (temporarily, for Phase 1)** | We need to run `pnpm db:push` from your laptop once. Phase 4 flips this to No. |
| Master username | `ema_admin` | Avoid the default `postgres` for slightly better security through obscurity. |
| Master password | **Auto-generate, store in Secrets Manager** | Don't pick a password yourself. Let AWS create one and Secrets Manager will hold it. |

**Estimated monthly cost (Phase 1 setup only):** ~$22/month (db.t4g.micro + 20 GB gp3 + backups, with af-south-1 ~15-20% pricing premium vs other regions). Phase 2 backend compute adds ~$30–45/mo on top.

### 1.2 Step-by-step in AWS Console

1. **Sign in to AWS Console** → top-right region selector → **Africa (Cape Town) af-south-1**. Confirm before clicking anything else. (Note: af-south-1 may need to be **opted in** the first time you use it — Account → AWS Regions → Enable af-south-1. Takes a few minutes.)

2. Navigate to **RDS** → **Create database**.

3. **Choose a database creation method:** Standard create.

4. **Engine options:**
   - Engine type: **PostgreSQL**
   - Edition: PostgreSQL
   - Engine Version: **PostgreSQL 16.x** (pick the highest 16.x available; do not pick 17 yet — pg-boss v12 not yet certified on 17)

5. **Templates:** **Production** (gives sensible defaults; we override specific things below).

6. **Settings:**
   - DB instance identifier: `emigration-assist-prod`
   - Master username: `ema_admin`
   - Credentials management: **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager** ← important
   - Encryption key: `aws/secretsmanager` (default)

7. **Instance configuration:**
   - Burstable classes: **db.t4g.micro**

8. **Storage:**
   - Storage type: **gp3**
   - Allocated storage: **20** GiB
   - Storage autoscaling: **Enabled**, max 100 GiB

9. **Connectivity:**
   - Compute resource: Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource
   - VPC: **Default VPC** (we'll switch to a private setup in Phase 4 if you want; default VPC is fine for now)
   - DB subnet group: default
   - **Public access: Yes** (TEMPORARY — will be flipped to No in Phase 4)
   - VPC security group: **Create new** → name it `emigration-assist-rds-sg`
   - Availability Zone: No preference
   - Database port: 5432

10. **Database authentication:** Password authentication (default).

11. **Monitoring:** Enable Performance Insights (free tier), 7-day retention.

12. **Additional configuration (expand the section):**
    - Initial database name: **`ema_prod`** ← important, otherwise no DB is created
    - DB parameter group: default
    - Backup retention: **7 days**
    - Encryption: Enabled (default)
    - Deletion protection: **Enabled**
    - Performance Insights: keep enabled

13. Click **Create database**. Provisioning takes ~5–10 minutes.

### 1.3 Lock the security group to your laptop's IP

While RDS provisions:

1. Go to **EC2 → Security Groups** → find `emigration-assist-rds-sg`.
2. **Inbound rules** → Edit → there should already be a rule for port 5432.
3. Change Source from `0.0.0.0/0` (anywhere) to **My IP** — AWS auto-detects your current public IP.
4. Save.

**Why:** without this, anyone on the public internet who guesses your RDS endpoint + master password could connect. "My IP" restricts to your current location only. (Phase 4 removes public access entirely.)

If your laptop IP changes (different network, VPN, etc.) before Phase 4, just re-edit this rule. After Phase 4 it doesn't matter.

### 1.4 Retrieve the connection string

Once RDS shows **Available**:

1. RDS console → click your `emigration-assist-prod` instance.
2. Top of page: **Connectivity & security** tab → copy the **Endpoint** (e.g. `emigration-assist-prod.abc123xyz.af-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`).
3. Top of page: **Configuration** tab → scroll to "Master credentials ARN" → click the linked Secrets Manager entry.
4. In Secrets Manager: **Retrieve secret value** → copy the password.

Build your connection string:

```
postgresql://ema_admin:<URL-ENCODED-PASSWORD>@<endpoint>:5432/ema_prod?sslmode=require
```

**URL-encode the password** if it contains special characters (`@`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `:`, `%`). Easiest: paste it into any URL-encoding tool, or replace by hand using this table: `@` → `%40`, `/` → `%2F`, `?` → `%3F`, `#` → `%23`, `:` → `%3A`, `%` → `%25`, `+` → `%2B`.

`?sslmode=require` is **mandatory** — RDS rejects unencrypted connections by default and the app code expects SSL.

### 1.5 Push schema + seed admin user

From your laptop (or from the Replit Shell — both work since RDS is temporarily public). The repo uses **Drizzle ORM**, and the push script lives in the `@workspace/db` package — not at repo root:

```bash
# From the repo root. Set the prod DATABASE_URL ONLY for this command —
# do NOT export it permanently or paste it into Replit Secrets.
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://ema_admin:<password>@<endpoint>:5432/ema_prod?sslmode=require' \
  pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

This invokes `drizzle-kit push --config ./drizzle.config.ts`, which reads the schema from `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts` and **directly syncs** RDS to match — no migration files generated, no migration history table. (That's how Drizzle's `push` works, similar to Prisma's `db push` and unlike Sequelize/TypeORM which use versioned migrations.)

You should see Drizzle output like:
```
[✓] Pulling schema from database...
[✓] Changes applied
```

This creates **all application tables** (leads, cases, admin, campaigns, templates, lifecycle, etc.). pg-boss tables (`pgboss.*` schema) will be auto-created later when the Beanstalk backend boots and pg-boss runs its own startup migration — don't worry about them now.

**If `drizzle-kit push` asks "Is X column created or renamed from Y?":** for a brand-new empty database, always answer **created** (it's an empty DB — there's nothing to rename from). This prompt only appears when push detects ambiguity.

**Seed the bootstrap admin user:** the api-server seeds a demo admin (`demo@admin.local` / `ChangeMe!2026`) automatically on first boot when `admin_users` is empty. To override with your real credentials, set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` as Beanstalk environment properties in Phase 2 — the seed runs once on first Beanstalk deploy, then never again.

### 1.6 Verify

Quick sanity check that the schema exists:

```bash
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://ema_admin:<password>@<endpoint>:5432/ema_prod?sslmode=require' \
  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c '\dt'
```

You should see ~20+ tables. If you don't have `psql` installed locally, skip — we'll verify via App Runner in Phase 2.

### 1.7 Save the connection string somewhere safe

You'll need it again in Phase 2 when configuring App Runner. Save it to your password manager — **don't** paste it into Replit Secrets, into git, or into the chat with me. The whole point of Secrets Manager is that even AWS can rotate it without you ever needing to touch the value.

## Phase 1 done — what to tell the agent

When everything above is complete, message me:

> "Phase 1 done. RDS is provisioned, schema is pushed."

I'll then start Phase 2 (Dockerfile + App Runner setup). I won't need the connection string itself — only confirmation it works.

---

## Phase 2 — Dockerfile + backend compute (preview, not started yet)

**Compute service: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Docker platform).** Recommended for af-south-1.

### Why Elastic Beanstalk and not ECS Fargate

App Runner — our first choice — isn't available in af-south-1, so the realistic options are Elastic Beanstalk or ECS Fargate. Quick comparison:

| | Elastic Beanstalk (Docker) | ECS Fargate |
|---|---|---|
| Setup effort | ~3 hours | ~1.5 days |
| Ongoing ops | Single console page, push to GitHub via CodePipeline | Task definitions, services, ALB, target groups, ECR — multiple consoles |
| Single-replica enforcement (your pg-boss code needs this) | "Single-instance environment" — one click | Set `desiredCount: 1` in service def |
| Auto-deploy on git push | Yes, via CodePipeline (one-time setup) | Yes, via CodePipeline + buildspec.yml |
| HTTPS / load balancer | Auto-provisioned ALB + ACM cert | You wire it manually |
| Scaling later if you need it | Single-instance → load-balanced is one toggle | Already there, just bump count |

Elastic Beanstalk gives you the closest experience to App Runner that's available in af-south-1. ECS Fargate is the right answer if you outgrow EB or need more control — neither is true today.

### What's coming when you say "Phase 1 done"

- A `Dockerfile` at the repo root — multi-stage pnpm-aware build that produces a small runtime image (~150 MB) running `node ./artifacts/api-server/dist/index.mjs`
- A `Dockerrun.aws.json` so Beanstalk knows how to run the container
- A `.ebextensions/` config dir for env-var defaults and health check tuning
- Step-by-step EB setup (create application, create environment, connect to RDS via security-group rule, set env vars from Replit Secrets, hook GitHub via CodePipeline)
- Full env-var checklist mapping your current Replit Secrets → Beanstalk environment properties
- Smoke-test plan before Phase 3 cutover

Estimated cost for Phase 2 backend: ~$30–45/month (single t3.small EC2 + ALB + minimal data transfer). ALB is the largest line item at ~$22/mo — unavoidable when you want HTTPS.

Will deliver when Phase 1 is signed off.
